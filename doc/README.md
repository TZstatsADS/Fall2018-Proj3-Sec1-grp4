# Project: Can you unscramble a blurry image? 

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders. The final file is in main.RMD file. Please knit this RMD file after downloading the entire project. 

For the main.RMD file, we present 

* Part I

Part I we present baseline model and we are using instructed package "GBM". Following the instructed steps, we approach this analysis starting with feature extraction, cross validation, prediction using superResolution script. 

Note: In superResolution, we saved PSNR code in the script. The images are directed stored in data folder and we hide PSNR code in the script to ensure the script runs smoothly. 

* Part II

Part II follows the same procedure for a fair competition changing only the predictive algorithm to XGBoost.
